During my time at Verizon, I have had the opportunity to contribute to the back-end operations, focusing on ensuring that only eligible customers receive promotions. However, more recently, I transitioned to working on the front end, where my responsibilities involve displaying data on user interfaces.

As a member of a team working on  backend development , my primary focus involved designing and implementing APIs(JF 3.2 | JF 3.5 | JF 3.6 | JF 4.6 | JF 4.8). for data retrieval, exporting, and filtering. Throughout the project, key technologies such as Java, the Spring Framework, and Toad for query testing played a crucial role in achieving project milestones.

Among my experiences, this particular task holds a special place as a remarkable opportunity for personal growth. At that time, I was unfamiliar with the technologies involved, and it was my first encounter with working on a production-level application. This presented a significant challenge. Throughout the process, I acquired a wealth of knowledge and expertise, which in turn to huge confidence. The creation of these endpoints started with the controller file responsible for handling all HTTP requests. The subsequent service file contains the essential logic for data retrieval and exporting to Excel files. Lastly, the model file encapsulated the class responsible for saving the data.
