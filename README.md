#  Multiverse Final Portfolio

Throughout my time at Multiverse and Verizon, I embarked on an apprenticeship journey that allowed me to explore and utilize a diverse range of technologies. From initially crafting static web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to presently developing complete applications using React and RESTful APIs, it has been an incredibly fruitful and fulfilling year.

This repository is a collection of the work and learning that I've done throughout my time here at Multiverse / Verizon.
